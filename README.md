# Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a transformative technology that will profoundly impact various domains, but particularly the techology and information security fileds. Below are some of the most effective tactics to harness the power of AI:

# AI-Assisted Coding and Peer Review
AI coding tools offer ease of use, but initial code quality may be subpar. However, AI systems excel at reviewing code and iteratively enhancing it. Employing multiple iterations of code written and reviewed by different AI systems has demonstrated exceptional results. Even when AI-generated code undergoes improvements by another AI system (e.g., parameterization or formatting), the original AI is adept at identifying areas for further enhancement that might otherwise be overlooked or require extensive knowledge and time to achieve comparable outcomes.

Examples of entirely 'AI written' and 'AI peer reviewed' code:

# AI Code 'Transmografication' 
AI can often transmogrify code from one programming language to another, or at least provide strong and mostly accurate guidance when simply wanting to change from one script or programming language to another. This output can (and probably should) be AI Peer Reviewed. 

# Prompt Engineering
The task description for AI is embedded within the prompt itself. Crafting well-structured and precise prompts ensures accurate and context-aware AI responses.

# Prompt Injection
Prompt injection involves manipulating the prompt to bypass or subvert the AI's predefined limitations or guardrails. This technique can range from avoiding specific "key words" to posing alternative questions that lead to the desired answer. However, it's worth noting that prompt injection is often detected and mitigated promptly by AI systems.

# AI Peer Review of information
Leveraging multiple AI systems to review information offers additional validation, context, and helps narrow down key areas for further research. Employing diverse AI perspectives enhances the overall reliability and accuracy of the information.
