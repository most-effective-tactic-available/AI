# AI
AI will impact the world in a dramatic way. I am listing them in the order of impact in my limited experience.

# AI Coding + AI Peer Review - 
AI coding is beneficial, but seems to be pretty limited. However, AI tends to be better at reviewing and incrementally improving the code. Therefore, having multiple iterations of code written and reviewed by different AI systems has yielded extremely effective results. Even if an AI was used to to craft the code, once another AI makes changes to help improve (paramterizing, formatting, etc.), the original AI is appears to 'better spot' areas for improvement that otherwise seem like 'blind spots' to the system. 

# Prompt Engineering - 
the description of the task that the AI is supposed to accomplish is embedded within the promt(s) themselves.

# Prompt Injection - 
Using the prompt to subvert/bypass the 'guardrails' of the AI. Sometimes this is as easy as simply avoiding 'key words', asking a different question that would have the 'same answer'. However, prompt injection is often quickly discovered and  

# AI Peer Review - 
Using multiple AI systems to review the information. This will often provide additional validation of the information, provide additional context, or at least narrow down the key areas to further research
